Boss Highlights adds a few nifty features including: 
  	 Despawn Messages
  	 Respawn Timer
  	 Item Map Detection
  	 Boss Radar
  	 Informational Boss Log
This mod has NO effect on the way the game is played other than some visual information that could be considered as "quality of life". More in-depth descriptions of content available on the homepage, along with future content, github open source code, and the link to my discord server.

Note: Boss Highlights heavily depends on other mods to provide information via PostSetupContent(). If you wish to add your own mod's bosses you can find out how within the homepage.
