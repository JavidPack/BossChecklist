[h2]Boss Checklist[/h2]
Boss Checklist lets you view a checklist of all available bosses while playing so you can progress through them as you defeat them. Toggle the checklist with the hotkey assigned to it in the settings. Visit [u]'Settings->Controls->Keybindings'[/u] to check or set the current hotkey. If you would like a mod to be supported, please encourage the modder to add support to this mod.

[h2]Boss Log[/h2]
The Boss Log is an enhancement of the traditional boss checklist and comes with many configurable features and customizations. Each entry on the checklist will have its own dedicated page with more information about the boss, including which mod it comes from, spawn information, spawn item crafting, loot table checklist and collectible item checklist. Modders are able to register their boss content to the log using Mod calls.

[h2]Other Features[/h2]
There are other optional features included as well, which can enhance boss fight gameplay. Features include:
[list]
    [*]Boss Log Records, including boss fight duration and hits taken
    [*]Boss despawn messages displayed in chat
    [*]Boss radar for bosses that are off-screen
    [*]Specific boss loot appears on the fullscreen map and mini-map
